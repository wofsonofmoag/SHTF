 SHTF
The acronym SHTF means when shit hits the fan. It’s a situation associated with chaos, panic, and unpredictability.
Having a SHTF plan ready is a good way to prepare for the unknown and will allow you to stay self-reliant. People sometimes jab at preppers for being paranoid, but preppers don’t mind because they know the people who look at them as “weird” will be exactly the type asking them for help.

Are you ready?

We’ve all seen images of the aftermath of hurricanes, tsunamis, wicked floods, and seemingly endless wars in many countries, like many in the Middle East. 
While some of these scenarios are unlikely, I think you get the idea, you need to be ready. 
Ask yourself, are you ready if a situation like that comes to an area near you?

It’s also important to have a SHTF plan ready for every season. For example, if SHTF in the winter you’ll need a lot more gear to stay warm/alive.
Have a SHTF plan? Part of the prepper plan is keeping your finger on the pulse of news that could hint at future catastrophe.
