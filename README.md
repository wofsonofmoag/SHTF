# SHTF
The acronym SHTF means when shit hits the fan. It’s a situation associated with chaos, panic, and unpredictability.
Having a SHTF plan ready is a good way to prepare for the unknown and will allow you to stay self-reliant. People sometimes jab at preppers for being paranoid, but preppers don’t mind because they know the people who look at them as “weird” will be exactly the type asking them for help.

Every time I turn on the news there is chaos in the world. Shit is hitting the fan big time, whether it be due to a flood, hurricane, or other situation. It’s crazy how helpless people are.
Just think…

When even when just a relatively minor storm or threat is coming people rush to store and stock up on the essentials in-case they can’t make it out for a few days.

But…

The store shelves quickly thin… I’m from Pennsylvania, and even when a minor snow storm is coming this happens. Now just think of all the potential SHTF scenarios that could arise. People will lose their minds.

Consider the Current State of Things

Think about some of the current world leaders, I’m not going to mention anyone specifically, *cough*… Rocket Man. They aren’t exactly trustworthy or stable. They’re one bad day away from turning the world upside down.

Are you ready?

We’ve all seen images of the aftermath of hurricanes, tsunamis, wicked floods, and seemingly endless wars in many countries, like many in the Middle East. While some of these scenarios are unlikely, I think you get the idea, you need to be ready. Ask yourself, are you ready if a situation like that comes to an area near you?

It’s also important to have a SHTF plan ready for every season. For example, if SHTF in the winter you’ll need a lot more gear to stay warm/alive.
